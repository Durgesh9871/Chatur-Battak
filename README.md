# Hackathon Project 

Our 36-hour hackathon project - a multiplayer game that combines trivia quiz challenges with a fun and engaging user interface!

In this fast-paced game, players can join together in real-time to answer trivia questions and compete for the highest score. The questions cover a variety of topics, ranging from pop culture and entertainment to science and technology, ensuring there's something for everyone to enjoy.

But what really sets this game apart is its incredible user interface. We've worked tirelessly to create an experience that's both visually stunning and easy to navigate, with bold colors, dynamic animations, and intuitive controls that make it easy to jump in and start playing right away.

Whether you're looking to challenge your friends or meet new people from around the world, our multiplayer quiz game is the perfect way to test your knowledge, have some fun, and enjoy.

# Team Work Efforts:

First of all, we created a Slack and zoom group to establish communication between all the team members. 
Then we connected over zoom meet for further discussion about assigned project.

In a zoom meet we divideed small parts of project to all the team-member.

We discussed about past days work and present day work, if any one face issue all the team member helps to solve the problem.

All push the data in Git-hub to their respective branch and merge them to main branch.

Finally we make the presentation of the project.
